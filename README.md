This repo contains the material and additional resources for the Indivudal Research Project for the Applied Algorithms & Data structures Course at Wenzhou-Kean University.

## Project Summary
Focusing on the algorithm design and implementation of the diff functionality widely used in Source Version Control tools, Git for example, Genetic Engineering and Research, etc., this study introduced the Shortest Edit Script (SES) problem, reviewed several common Diff algorithms, analyzed design and performance, and gave a performance test at the end to evaluate their practical value.

## Project Report
Written in LaTeX using the [ACM LaTeX templet](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sigplan-proceedings-template/rfvsrhgmghtc), the report titled *Review of the Shortest Edit Script Problem AndDifference Algorithms* can be checked [here](./report/report.pdf). The LaTeX source can also be found in this [directory](./report/).

> **NOTICE:** The report is **not finished** yet, please check [Table of Contents](./report/README.md#table-of-contents) or read the [report](./report.pdf) to see the current progress. The code part of the project is already completed, check it [here](../demo/).

## Project Code Part
For algorithm design demonstration and performance test, the algorithms invovled in the project were implemented in Go Language and encapsulated in a commonline utility. The code part of the project can be accessed [here](./demo/).
